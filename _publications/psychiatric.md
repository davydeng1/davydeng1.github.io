As digital technologies permeate every aspect of human lives, they bring both positive and negative impacts of psychiatric disorders and mental health. While there have been a plethora of evidence on the increasing incidence of psychitriac disorders due to digital technologies, there are fewer studies that focus on the opportunities that technology can also open for better psychitric support. We performed several studies on how the digital era can be leveraged to positively addresses many challenges of psychiatric disorders including stigma, peer support and access in low-and-middle income countries.
