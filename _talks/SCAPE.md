In order to replicate the whole brain in silico, neural recording needs to be high resolution (single-neuron), high-speed, large field of view to cover the entire nervous system and should ideally be done during naturalistic behaviors. To date, a microscope that satisifies all of these requirements do not exist even for C. elegans. However, promising approaches such as Oblique Planar Light Sheet Microscope (OPM) offers paths to reach the goal. One of the best performing OPMs is the SCAPE microscope [^1]. However it lacks sufficient axial resolution to fully resolve every single neuron in C. elegans. I am building the world's first microscope that can enable true full nervous system high speed recording during behaviors by giving dual-view capability to SCAPE, which can be converted to near isotropic resolution through fusion deconvolution processing. This technology will give us unbiased comprehensive neural activity datasets that will be critical for WBE.
