I am a third-year joint doctoral student at the [Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology (HST)](https://hst.mit.edu/) program and a trainee in the [Neuroimaging Training Program](https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp/neuroimaging-training-program) as a [MathWorks Fellow](https://engineering.mit.edu/students/graduate-student-fellowships/mathworks-fellows/) at MIT, where I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Ed Boyden](https://synthneuro.org/) and [Prof. Gabriel Kreiman](https://klab.tch.harvard.edu/). As a PhD minor, I am also part of the [Humanitarian Studies Concentration](https://hsph.harvard.edu/degrees-and-programs/concentrations/humanitarian-studies-concentration/) at Harvard. Most of my time is spent developing various technologies towards whole brain emulation (WBE). My research is multi-disciplinary, spanning chemistry, physics, neuroscience and computation. I choose to focus my energy on C. elegans because it is an important and tractable first step and can serve as a groundtruth to evaluate the right approach for scaling up to mammalian and human WBE in the future. 

Previously, I received B.S. in chemistry, B.A. in genetics and genomics and B.A. in psychology from [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Dan Portnoy](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/portnoy/) on the biochemical mechanisms of oxygen-dependent intracellular replication in anaerobic pathogens as a [BSP Research Fellow](https://bsp.berkeley.edu/) supported by the Hellman Foundation. I then received S.M. in computational biology from [Harvard University](https://hsph.harvard.edu/program/sm-computational-biology-quantitative-genetics/), where I worked with [Prof. Rameen Beroukhim](https://beroukhimlab.org/team/rameen-beroukhim/) as a [Point Foundation Scholar](https://pointfoundation.org/scholarships/flagship) and a [Sinclair Kennedy Fellow](https://worldwide.harvard.edu/sinclair-kennedy-traveling-fellowships). 

Outside of science, I am devoted to social impact, community building, humanitarian medicine and biotech entrepreneurship. I am a [Davos50](https://www.weforum.org/meetings/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2025/) delegate and [Future50 Foresight Fellow](https://initiatives.weforum.org/global-foresight-network/future50) from the [Global Shapers Community](https://www.globalshapers.org/) and [Global Foresight Network](https://initiatives.weforum.org/global-foresight-network/home), both under the World Economic Forum. I have also been previously involved in [Nucleate](https://nucleate.org/locations/boston-ma/), a student-run biotech startup incubator as a co-managing director in Boston and a co-founder and co-president in [GFLI@MIT](https://gfli.mit.edu/), the first MIT support network for first-generation low-income graduate student community.

I am also interested in foresight framework and intergenerational fairness, especially given the rapid technological shifts, for which I had a panel discussion at the Davos 2025 Annual Meeting entitled [Generation Uncertain](https://www.weforum.org/meetings/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2025/sessions/generation-uncertain/). The recording is online and open to the public.
